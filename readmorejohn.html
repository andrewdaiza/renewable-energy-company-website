              <h4>JOHN DAIZA, PRESIDENT AND CEO AND MANAGING MEMBER</h4>
              <p class="pages-p">
                John Daiza has provided leadership within the energy and power industry for over 30 years (specifically
                within the Utilities, IPP's, EPC/D&B and O&M Sectors encompassing conventional and renewable IP
                technology platforms, etc.). He has been a senior level executive affiliated with such distinguished
                firms as General Electric, Ahlstrom, BP Power, Consumers Energy, Parsons Corp., and Mosbacher Power
                Group (MPG). Mr. Daiza has developed, financed, built, owned and managed the operation of over 20
                utility-grade power plants (of 200 MW or larger in size/scope) within the US and on a worldwide basis.
                He has spearheaded and negotiated several large M&A's including two major multi-billion dollar mergers
                including the merger between MPG and Tampa Electric Power Services (in 1999) and Ahlstrom's merger with
                Foster Wheeler (in 1994). Mr. Daiza was also a managing partner of International Power Partners and the
                CEO of Optimum Energy, two very successful IPP startup firms (in the mid-1990's and mid-2000's,
                respectively) within the space of development, construction, ownership and operation of conventional and
                renewable power applications and cutting-edge smart grid IP technology for the T&D Network and related
                infrastructure throughout the world. In addition to the M&A activities, Mr. Daiza has successfully
                structured and negotiated a number of highly leveraged and profitable JVA’s, PPP's, JDA's, strategic
                alliances, and licensing and cross licensing agreements with a number of global multinational companies.
                Mr. Daiza has also served as a senior advisor to the US Government (DOD/DOE) and the Governing Council
                of Iraq where he was Executive Director in charge of Operations and Project Management of major electric
                energy stations and related Power Grid (T&D) projects in connection with the construction, repowering
                and rehabilitation of Iraq during the war campaign (from 2003 - 2005). Mr. Daiza has worked in over 20
                countries during his distinguished career (including within the USA, Europe/EU, Asia/Pacific Rim and the
                Mideast, MENA & GCC's). Mr. Daiza has successfully managed a multi-billion $ budget with P&L
                accountability for the Pentagon, Parsons, Ahlstrom and MPG. He is regularly sought after as speaker at a
                number of global energy conferences and symposia. Mr. Daiza received his bachelor's degree in Physics
                from the University of Michigan. He’s done extensive post-graduate MBA work at Northwestern University
                and participated in an executive management program at Harvard University and is a certified Maxwell
                Leadership Coach, Mentor and Trainer.
