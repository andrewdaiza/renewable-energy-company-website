            CENTERS WITHIN TARGETED STRATEGIC GLOBAL MARKETS.</h4>
          <p class="pages-p">
            Our strategic vision is to be highly-visible, value-added, solution-driven and growth-oriented energy firm
            specializing within the renewable sector and sustainable development arena. Our intention is to build a
            premier energy company with world-class energy assets and technological innovation through a highly talented
            and experienced “core” management team that will execute our strategic plan to transform our portfolio of
            generating assets for long-term growth and profitability. Our goal is to execute our innovative paradigm and
            sustainable development strategy to benefit the commercial, industrial, federal government, local
            communities, and key international markets that we will serve with each GIE-CEC we build in cities and
            municipalities throughout the World; and with the firm expectation that we will achieve superior financial
            returns on a long-term risk-adjusted basis for our stakeholders.

            We are uniquely positioned within the power industry and have the “critical mass” of technical expertise,
            project development skills, operational management acumen, financial management expertise, and an extensive
            network of worldwide contacts, connections and relationships that are prerequisite to achieving our
            strategic vision and transforming our unique set of clean-tech innovative systems, human capital resources,
            and portfolio of projects into quantitatively successful long-term and sustainable financial outcome. Our
            management team has a combined over 150 years of experience and expertise in the energy business including
            within the renewable space.

          GIE’s credibility reflects the quality and depth of the management team and highly reputable staff of
          executives, developers, project managers, engineers, designers, financial and legal analysts, and other
          specialists and experts, as well as our prospective portfolio of fundamentally sound and commercially viable
          projects. The track record of our management team in ensuring careful assessment and mitigation of risk
          factors will facilitate a highly successful implementation of critical risk management tools, while
          judiciously deploying skilled labor and certain technologies to the projects that we will develop, acquire,
          build, own and operate. This approach will ensure solid future revenue growth and yield a measure of GIE's
          liquidity to achieve strong and robust return-on-investment.

          Our energy initiative is intended to help the strategic countries (where we’ll conduct our business
          operations) by deploying environmentally-responsible and clean sources of energy technologies while achieving
          our growth objectives and priorities and, in the process, producing significant shareholder value and solid
          EBITDA/ROI/IRR on a long-term basis.
